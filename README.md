# vscode-profiles

Open different folders with different profiles on VSCode.

Since VSCode version 1.75.1.
> We are happy to announce that the Profiles feature is now generally available in VS Code. A Profile can include extensions, settings, keyboard shortcuts, UI state, tasks, and user snippets. You can customize VS Code for different development scenarios like data science, documentation writing, or for multiple programming languages like Python or Java. If you have different VS Code setups based on workflow such as "Work" or "Demo", you can also save those as different profiles. You can open multiple workspaces (folders) with different profiles applied simultaneously.
